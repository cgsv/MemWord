If you have Lingoes Dictionary voice package installed, you could add the voice file path and the application will automatically pronounce each word as you watch it. Also, there is a text area for you to type the word as you memorize it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
